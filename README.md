Harvard in Africa

The CAS (Committee on African Studies) interactive web map visualizes the number of students by country in Africa for 2012 and 2013. Also, a pie chart is associated to display the purpose of travel and school affilation. It's built using google map api v3, google fusion table and google chart api (http://africa.harvard.edu/resources/harvard-in-africa/).
